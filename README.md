# HOPE

The desktop application called ‘HOPE’, allows children suffering from Speech and Motor Impairments to communicate easily with others.  To communicate and form words, these children cannot use a regular keyboard and click on a specific key. So, a scan mode, scanning the alphabets is achieved, for selection of a particular alphabet, by clicking anywhere on the screen. The voice over during the scan is provided using TTS. The software has also incorporated word prediction, which makes it better in terms of reducing the number of required keystrokes, by predicting the word as you are typing and also predicting the next word.

The earlier version which was an initiative from the students and faculty at IIT-Madras and built using Python, and the prediction was based on the frequency of usage of the words by the user.

This version uses the bigram model of word prediction using the autocomplete module of Python

Also Pyttsx3 Module is used for TTS in this current software replacing the earlier pyspeech module and Tkinter for GUI instead of wxpython
